# # Exemplar: Discover what is in your dataset

# ## Introduction
# 
# In this activity, you will discover characteristics of a dataset and use visualizations to analyze the data. This will develop and strengthen your skills in **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and your knowledge of functions that allow you to explore and visualize data. 
# 
# EDA is an essential process in a data science workflow. As a data professional, you will need to conduct this process to better understand the data at hand and determine how it can be used to solve the problem you want to address. This activity will give you an opportunity to practice that process and prepare you for EDA in future projects.
# 
# In this activity, you are a member of an analytics team that provides insights to an investing firm. To help them decide which companies to invest in next, the firm wants insights into **unicorn companies**–companies that are valued at over one billion dollars. The data you will use for this task provides information on over 1,000 unicorn companies, including their industry, country, year founded, and select investors. You will use this information to gain insights into how and when companies reach this prestigious milestone and to make recommendations for next steps to the investing firm.

# ## Step 1: Imports

# ### Import libraries and packages 
# 
# First, import the relevant Python libraries and modules. Use the `pandas` library and the `matplotlib.pyplot` module.

# In[2]:

# **Question:** What do you think the "Date Joined" column represents?
# 
# - The "Date Joined" column represents when the company became a "unicorn," reaching one billion dollars in valuation.

# **Question:** What do you think the "Select Investors" column represents?
# 
# - The "Select Investors" column represents the top investors in the company.

# ### Assess the size of the dataset
# 
# Get a sense of how large the dataset is. The `size` property that DataFrames have can help.

# In[5]:


# How large the dataset is

### YOUR CODE HERE ###

companies.size


# **Question:** What do you notice about the size of the dataset?
# 
# - The size of the dataset is 10740. This means that there are 10740 values in total across the whole dataset.

# ### Determine the shape of the dataset
# 
# Identify the number of rows and columns in the dataset. The `shape` property that DataFrames have can help.

# In[6]:


# Shape of the dataset

### YOUR CODE HERE ###

companies.shape


# **Question:** What do you notice about the shape of the dataset?
# 
# - The shape of the dataset is (1074, 10). The first number, 1074, represents the number of rows (also known as entries). The second number, 10, represents the number of columns. According to this dataset, there are 1074 unicorn companies as of March 2022, and this dataset also shows 10 aspects of each company. 

# ### Get basic information about the dataset
# 
# To further understand what the dataset entails, get basic information about the dataset, including the data type of values in each column. There is more than one way to approach this task. In this instance, use the `info()` function from `pandas`.

# In[7]:


# Get information

### YOUR CODE HERE ###

companies.info()


# **Question:** What do you notice about the type of data in the `Year Founded` column? Refer to the output from using `info()` above. Knowing the data type of this variable is helpful because it indicates what types of analysis can be done with that variable, how it can be aggregated with other variables, and so on.
# 
# - `Dtype` is listed as `int64` in the `Year Founded` column. This means that the year a company was founded is represented as an integer. 

# **Question:** What do you notice about the type of data in the `Date Joined` column? Refer to the output from using `info()` above. Knowing the data type of this variable is helpful because it indicates what types of analysis can be done with that variable and how the variable can be transformed to suit specific tasks.
# 
# - `Dtype` is listed as `object` for the `Date Joined` column. This means that the date a company became a unicorn is represented as an object. 

# ## Step 3: Statistical tests

# ### Find descriptive statistics
# 
# Find descriptive statistics and structure your dataset. The `describe()` function from the `pandas` library can help. This function generates statistics for the numeric columns in a dataset.  

# In[8]:


### Get descriptive statistics

### YOUR CODE HERE ###

companies.describe()


# **Question:** Based on the table of descriptive stats generated above, what do you notice about the minimum value in the `Year Founded` column? This is important to know because it helps you understand how early the entries in the data begin.
# 
# - The minimum value in the `Year Founded` column is 1919. This means that this dataset does not contain data on unicorn companies founded before 1919.

# **Question:** What do you notice about the maximum value in the `Year Founded` column? This is important to know because it helps you understand the most recent year captured by the data. 
# 
# - The maximum value in the `Year Founded` column is 2021. This means that this dataset does not include data on unicorn companies founded after 2021.

# ### Convert the `Date Joined` column to datetime
# 
# - Use pd.to_datetime() to convert the "Date Joined" column to datetime. 
# - Update the column with the converted values.
# - Use .info() to confirm that the update actually took place
# 
# You can use the `to_datetime()` function from the `pandas` library. This splits each value into year, month, and date components. This is an important step in data cleaning, as it makes the data in this column easier to use in tasks you may encounter. To name a few examples, you may need to compare "date joined" between companies or determine how long it took a company to become a unicorn. Having "date joined" in datetime form would help you complete such tasks.

# In[9]:


# Step 1. Use pd.to_datetime() to convert Date Joined column to datetime 
# Step 2. Update the column with the converted values

### YOUR CODE HERE ###

companies["Date Joined"] = pd.to_datetime(companies["Date Joined"])


# In[11]:


# Use .info() to confirm that the update actually took place

### YOUR CODE HERE ###

companies.info()


# ### Create a `Year Joined` column
# 
# It is common to encounter situations where you will need to compare the year joined with the year founded. The `Date Joined` column does not just have year—it has the year, month, and date. Extract the year component from the `Date Joined` column and add those year components into a new column to keep track of each company's year joined.

# In[14]:


# Step 1: Use .dt.year to extract year component from Date Joined column
# Step 2: Add the result as a new column named Year Joined to the DataFrame

### YOUR CODE HERE ###

companies["Year Joined"] = companies["Date Joined"].dt.year


# In[15]:


# Use .head() to confirm that the new column did get added

### YOUR CODE HERE ###

companies.head()


# ## Step 4: Results and evaluation

# ### Take a sample of the data
# 
# It is not necessary to take a sample of the data in order to conduct the visualizations and EDA that follow. But you may encounter scenarios in the future where you will need to take a sample of the data due to time and resource limitations. For the purpose of developing your skills around sampling, take a sample of the data and work with that sample for the next steps of analysis you want to conduct. Use the `sample()` function for this task.
# 
# - Use `sample()` with the `n` parameter set to `50` to randomly sample 50 unicorn companies from the data. Be sure to specify the `random_state` parameter to ensure reproducibility of your work. Save the result to a variable called `companies_sampled`.

# In[16]:


# Sample the data

### YOUR CODE HERE ###
companies_sample = companies.sample(n = 50, random_state = 42)


# ### Visualize the time it took companies to reach unicorn status
# 
# Visualize the longest time it took companies to reach unicorn status for each industry represented in the sample. To create a bar plot to visualize this, use the `bar()` function from the `matplotlib.pyplot` module. You'll first need to prepare the data.

# In[17]:


# Prepare data for plotting

### YOUR CODE HERE ###

# Create new `years_till_unicorn` column 
companies_sample["years_till_unicorn"] = companies_sample["Year Joined"] - companies_sample["Year Founded"]

# Group the data by `Industry`. For each industry, get the max value in the `years_till_unicorn` column.
grouped = (companies_sample[["Industry", "years_till_unicorn"]]
           .groupby("Industry")
           .max()
           .sort_values(by="years_till_unicorn")
          )
grouped


# Now, create a bar plot.

# In[18]:


# Create bar plot
# with Industry column as the categories of the bars
# and the difference in years between Year Joined column and Year Founded column as the heights of the bars

### YOUR CODE HERE ###

plt.bar(grouped.index, grouped["years_till_unicorn"])

# Set title

### YOUR CODE HERE ###

plt.title("Bar plot of maximum years taken by company to become unicorn per industry (from sample)")

# Set x-axis label

### YOUR CODE HERE ###

plt.xlabel("Industry")

# Set y-axis label

### YOUR CODE HERE ###

plt.ylabel("Maximum number of years")

# Rotate labels on the x-axis as a way to avoid overlap in the positions of the text  

### YOUR CODE HERE ###

plt.xticks(rotation=45, horizontalalignment='right')

# Display the plot

### YOUR CODE HERE ###

plt.show()

# **Question:** What do you observe from this bar plot?
# 
# - This bar plot shows that for this sample of unicorn companies, the largest value for maximum time taken to become a unicorn occurred in the Heath and Fintech industries, while the smallest value occurred in the Consumer & Retail industry.

# ### Visualize the maximum unicorn company valuation per industry
# 
# Visualize unicorn companies' maximum valuation for each industry represented in the sample. To create a bar plot to visualize this, use the `bar()` function from the `matplotlib.pyplot` module. Before plotting, create a new column that represents the companies' valuations as numbers (instead of strings, as they're currently represented). Then, use this new column to plot your data.

# In[19]:


# Create a column representing company valuation as numeric data

# Create new column
companies_sample['valuation_billions'] = companies_sample['Valuation']
# Remove the '$' from each value
companies_sample['valuation_billions'] = companies_sample['valuation_billions'].str.replace('$', '')
# Remove the 'B' from each value
companies_sample['valuation_billions'] = companies_sample['valuation_billions'].str.replace('B', '')
# Convert column to type int
companies_sample['valuation_billions'] = companies_sample['valuation_billions'].astype('int')
companies_sample.head()


# Now, prepare the data for modeling by performing the necessary calculations on it.

# In[20]:


# Prepare data for modeling
grouped = (companies_sample[["Industry", "valuation_billions"]]
           .groupby("Industry")
           .max()
           .sort_values(by="valuation_billions")
          )
grouped


# In[17]:


# Create bar plot
# with Industry column as the categories of the bars
# and new valuation column as the heights of the bars

### YOUR CODE HERE ###

plt.bar(grouped.index, grouped["valuation_billions"])

# Set title

### YOUR CODE HERE ###

plt.title("Bar plot of maximum unicorn company valuation per industry (from sample)")

# Set x-axis label

### YOUR CODE HERE ###

plt.xlabel("Industry")

# Set y-axis label

### YOUR CODE HERE ###

plt.ylabel("Maximum valuation in billions of dollars")

# Rotate labels on the x-axis as a way to avoid overlap in the positions of the text

# **Question:** What do you observe from this bar plot? 
# 
# - This bar plot shows that for this sample of unicorn companies, the highest maximum valuation occurred in the Artificial Intelligence industry, while the lowest maximum valuation occurred in the Auto & transportation, and Consumer & retail industries.

# ## Considerations
# 
# **What are some key takeaways that you learned from this lab?**
# 
# - Functions in the `pandas` library can be used to gather characteristics about the data at hand.
#   - The `info()` and `describe()` functions were especially useful for gathering basic information about a dataset and finding descriptive statistics, respectively.
# - Functions in the `matplotlib.pyplot` module can be used to create visualizations to further understand specific aspects of the data.
#   - The `bar()` function allowed you to create bar plots that helped visualize categorical information about the data. You were able to visualize the maximum years to become a unicorn and maximum valuation for each industry represented in the sample taken from the data.
# 
# **What findings would you share with others?**
# 
# - There are 1074 unicorn companies represented in this dataset.
# - Some companies took longer to reach unicorn status but have accrued high valuation as of March 2022. Companies could take longer to achieve unicorn status for a number of reasons, including requiring more funding or taking longer to develop a business model. 
# 
# **What recommendations would you share with stakeholders based on these findings?**
# 
# It may be helpful to focus more on industry specifics. Next steps to consider:
# - Identify the main industries that the investing firm is interested in investing in. 
# - Select a subset of this data that includes only companies in those industries. 
# - Analyze that subset more closely. Determine which companies have higher valuation but do not have as many investors currently. They may be good candidates to consider investing in.
